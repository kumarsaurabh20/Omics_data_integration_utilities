## Robinson MD et al.
## 8 August 2012

# If you wish to run ABCD-DNA, see the documentation of the 
# R/Bioconductor 'Repitools' package
# devel   - http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/Repitools.html
# release - http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Repitools.html

# The files in this R commands give all the commands used to do the analyses 
# and make the figures for the paper.
# If you wish to re-run them, you may need some of the pre-processed data
# that is available at:
# http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch/robinson_lab/ABCD-DNA/ABCD-DNA.html
